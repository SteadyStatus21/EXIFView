<p>A note of <strong>privacy</strong>. I made this service that runs entirely in <strong>your browser</strong>. I will <strong>never</strong> see your images, as they are processed on your computer. This is a common misconception. More questions? Open an <a href="https://github.com/SteadyStatus21/EXIFView/issues/new/choose">issue</a> on GitHub.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure that you have the image downloaded or saved somewhere!</li>
<li>Open the <a href="https://steadystatus21.github.io/EXIFView/">tool (External Site)</a>, and select <code>Choose File</code>.</li>
<li>This will open a dialog, where you can select an image from your local computer.<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteadyStatus21/EXIFView/main/images/Upload.png" alt="Upload prompt"></li>
<li>Then, select that image from your computer, and now the text next to <code>Choose File</code> should be the file name you just inserted.</li>
<li>Select <code>Load File</code> and scroll down.</li>
<li>The important things to look for are:
<ul>
<li><code>ExposureTime</code> - Shows Exposure Time in Seconds (ex. 1/1000)</li>
<li><code>FNumber</code> - a.k.a. Aperture, shown in f-stop respectively. (ex. f/1.8)</li>
<li><code>ISOSpeedRatings</code> - Shows ISO Rating from the Camera. (ex. 3200)</li>
<li>and,</li>
<li><code>ExposureMode</code> - Shows whether the Camera was using Manual mode (“Manual exposure”) or Auto mode (“Auto exposure”).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="to-do-this-you-need-to-understand-that-the-google-drive-in-the-file-selector-is-in-the-left-pane">To do this, you need to understand that the Google Drive in the File Selector is in the left pane:</h3>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteadyStatus21/EXIFView/main/images/GDrive.png" alt="GDrive"></p>
<ul>
<li>This process is mostly the same, where you need to click on <code>Choose File</code>, and navigate to the Google Drive tab, where it will let you navigate your Drive.</li>
<li>Once selected, select <code>Open</code>. <strong>Caution: This can take a second to load, especially for larger files!</strong></li>
<li>Then, you can explore the EXIF info for that file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this guide makes things more clear for the tool, as I want it to be simple to use!</p>
